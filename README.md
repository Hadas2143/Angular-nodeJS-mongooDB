🍽️ Recipe Management Web Application
This full-stack recipe management system is designed to provide users with a seamless and interactive way to explore, manage, and share cooking recipes. The platform supports both regular users and administrators, offering a tailored experience based on user roles.

🧠 Project Overview
The application enables users to register, log in, browse a catalog of recipes, view recipe details, and contribute their own creations. It includes authentication and role-based permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like deleting or editing content.
